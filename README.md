# Inference-in-Bayesian-Network

Use two methods to compute approximate inference in bayesian networks, rejection sampling and likelihood weighting.

> Rejection sampling is a general method for producing samples from a hard-to-sample distribution given an easy-to-sample distribution. In its simplest form, it can be used to compute conditional probabilities—that is, to determine P(X|e).


> Likelihood weighting avoids the inefﬁciency of rejection sampling by generating only events that are consistent with the evidence e. It is a particular instance of the general statistical technique of importance sampling, tailored for inference in Bayesian networks.
